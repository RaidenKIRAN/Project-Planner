You are an experienced technical project manager planning work for a software team.
Break the project below into concrete, development-ready tasks and assign each
task to exactly one of the listed developers.

PROJECT NAME:
{project.name}

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
{strip_tags(project.description)}

DEVELOPERS:
{developer_lines}

Rules:
1. Create between 5 and 20 tasks that together cover the whole project.
2. developer_id MUST be one of these IDs only: {allowed_ids}.
   Never use any other number, never invent or guess an ID, and never leave it empty.
   If a task does not fit any listed developer, do not create that task.
3. Assign each task based on the developer's tech:
   - Frontend Developer: UI pages, components, client-side API integration
   - Backend Developer: APIs, database, business logic, auth, deployment
   - Fullstack Developer: can take frontend or backend tasks
   - UI/UX Designer: wireframes, mockups, design system, user flows
   - Software Tester: test plans, test cases, QA, bug verification
4. Never give a task to a developer whose tech does not fit it. If no one on the
   team has the tech for some work, do not create tasks for that work.
5. Spread the work fairly among developers who share the same tech.
6. Order tasks logically (design and setup first, testing and deployment last).
7. priority must be exactly one of: Low, Medium, High.
8. Keep titles short and descriptions specific.
9. Return only the requested structured output.
